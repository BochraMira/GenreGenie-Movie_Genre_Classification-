# Movie Genre Classification and Recommendation System


## Overview
This project leverages deep learning and natural language processing techniques to classify movie genres and recommend movies based on user input. The web interface, designed like a YouTube platform, allows users to browse and search for movie cards, save their favorite movies by creating an account, and receive genre predictions along with personalized movie recommendations.

## Features
- **Genre Classification**: Users can input a movie description, and the system will predict the genre using a trained deep learning model.
- **Movie Cards**: Users can browse through various movie cards with details like title, genre, and synopsis, and search for specific movies.
- **User Accounts**: By creating an account, users can save their favorite movie cards for easy access later.
- **Recommendation System**: On the "Predict Genre" page, users can input a description, receive a genre prediction, and get movie recommendations based on the predicted genre.


## How It Works
1. **Browse and Search**: Users can explore different movie cards and search for specific titles.
2. **Input Description**: On the "Predict Genre" page, users input a movie description.
3. **Genre Prediction**: The deep learning model predicts the genre based on the description.
4. **Movie Recommendations**: The system then recommends movies that align with the predicted genre.
5. **Save Favorites**: Users can save movie cards to their accounts for future reference.
